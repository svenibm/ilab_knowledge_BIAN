# BIAN Document Corpus for Q&A Pair Creation

## Overview

This repository consists of material designed to serve as a document corpus for creating question and answer (Q&A) pairs. This synthetic data is essential for fine-tuning a small Language Learning Model (LLM) locally, with the objective of enhancing the model's understanding of BIAN concepts.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to enable the LLM to comprehend and map existing functionality or text-snippets from a banking context to BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) Business and Service Domains. By leveraging the Q&A pairs generated from this corpus, the LLM will be better equipped to accurately interpret and align with BIAN standards.

## Contents

- **BIAN Documentation**: Detailed documents outlining various BIAN concepts, business domains, and service domains.
- **Banking Context Snippets**: Real-world examples and text-snippets from banking industry practices.
- **Synthetic Q&A Pairs**: Generated question and answer pairs derived from the provided documentation and context snippets.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure the documents are cleaned and formatted correctly for the LLM.
2. **Synthetic Data Creation**: Utilize the documents to create meaningful Q&A pairs.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Apply the synthetic Q&A data to locally fine-tune the LLM for improved understanding of BIAN concepts.

## Contributions

Contributions to expand and refine the document corpus are welcome. Please adhere to the guidelines provided in the repository to ensure consistency and quality.
